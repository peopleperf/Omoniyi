üé® Design Originality Principles

To ensure your website is original, personable, and non-templatey, the following creative approaches will be implemented:

‚ú® Layout & Flow:

Break from standard vertical stacking ‚Äî use storytelling sections that scroll horizontally or diagonally

Overlap visual blocks and animate text overlays that feel dynamic and unexpected

Custom transitions between sections (fade ‚Üí slide ‚Üí grow) via Framer Motion

‚úã Personal Interactions:

Use conversational CTAs and hover states with first-person voice

Embed your presence ‚Äî micro text reveals like ‚ÄúWhy I built this‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe moment this idea sparked‚Äù

Sticky floating element: ‚ÄúAsk me what I automate‚Äù that expands a personal automation panel

üñºÔ∏è Visual Identity:

Custom iconography where possible (via Lucide or Figma-made assets)

Motion-based ‚Äúterminal-style‚Äù interaction simulating HR automations (e.g. typing run buildHRworkflow())

No card templates with standard shadows or border radius

üìê Typography & Rhythm:

Unique spacing and vertical rhythm (not default Tailwind spacing)

Large expressive headlines paired with tightly stacked body copy
